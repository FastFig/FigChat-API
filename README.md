FigChat API Documentation
=========================

The FigChat API is used to integrate your application with FigChat.  It has two major components:
- An [iframe embed system](docs/iframe.md) for adding the chat client to your application.
- A [REST API](docs/REST.md) for creating and managing chat rooms.

Support for the API is available at [support@fastfig.com](mailto:support@fastfig.com).
